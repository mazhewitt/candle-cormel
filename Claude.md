# candle-coreml Standalone Crate Project

## PURPOSE
Extract candle-coreml from the Candle monorepo into a standalone publishable crate on crates.io, providing CoreML inference capabilities for Candle users independently of the main project.

## PROJECT MOTIVATION
- Original PR to Candle was ignored
- Need freedom to take the API in our own direction
- Provide CoreML integration as an add-on that can be referenced from Candle documentation
- Give users access to CoreML inference without waiting for upstream integration

## CURRENT STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Independent Repository Created!

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS
✅ DECIDED: Keep name as `candle-coreml`
- Describes exactly what it does (CoreML inference for Candle)
- Different from `coreml-rs` (generic swift-bridge bindings) 
- Our implementation uses objc2 directly with Candle-specific integration

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Research & Setup ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Research current candle-coreml structure and dependencies
2. ✅ Research and decide on crate name (candle-coreml chosen)
3. ✅ Create new standalone crate structure with proper Cargo.toml
4. ✅ Extract and adapt candle-coreml code for standalone use

### Phase 2: Dependencies & Integration ✅ COMPLETED
5. ✅ Update dependencies to use published candle crates from crates.io
6. ✅ Move standalone crate outside of Candle repo and init as new git repo
7. ✅ Remove any remaining Candle workspace dependencies
8. ✅ Create comprehensive documentation and examples

### Phase 3: Advanced Stateful Inference ✅ COMPLETED
9. ✅ Implement MLState support for autoregressive models
10. ✅ Add CoreMLState wrapper for persistent KV-cache
11. ✅ Add make_state() and predict_with_state() API methods  
12. ✅ Comprehensive testing for stateful functionality
13. ✅ Full backward compatibility with existing stateless API

### Phase 4: Publication Preparation
14. ⏳ Set up CI/CD for the standalone crate
15. ⏳ Prepare crate metadata for Cargo registry publication
16. ✅ Test standalone crate thoroughly before publication (12/12 tests pass)

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS FROM coreml-rs

| Feature | coreml-rs | Our candle-coreml |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Bindings | swift-bridge | objc2 direct |
| Purpose | Generic CoreML | Candle tensor integration |
| Scope | Raw CoreML bindings | Complete autoregressive inference engine |
| Integration | None | Candle device validation, tensor conversion |
| Error Handling | Generic | Candle error types |
| API Style | Generic | Follows Candle patterns (like candle-metal) |
| **Stateful Inference** | **Not supported** | **✅ MLState with persistent KV-cache** |
| **Autoregressive Models** | **Manual state mgmt** | **✅ Efficient streaming generation** |
| **Memory Efficiency** | **O(seq_len²)** | **✅ O(cache_len) constant memory** |

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION FEATURES

### Core Infrastructure
- CoreMLModel and CoreMLModelBuilder following T5-like patterns
- Device validation (accepts CPU/Metal, rejects CUDA)
- Comprehensive tensor conversion (F32/I64→I32 support)
- Full MLMultiArray ↔ Tensor conversion
- Integration tests with real .mlmodelc files
- Follows Candle conventions and error handling

### ✨ NEW: Stateful Inference Engine
- **CoreMLState wrapper**: Opaque handle for MLState with thread safety docs
- **make_state()**: Creates persistent state objects for autoregressive models
- **predict_with_state()**: Efficient streaming inference with KV-cache reuse
- **Memory optimization**: Constant O(cache_len) vs O(seq_len²) growth
- **Zero-copy continuation**: State advances cache pointer automatically
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing stateless API unchanged
- **Comprehensive testing**: State creation, persistence, validation, device compatibility

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
- Extract existing candle-coreml code from monorepo
- Update Cargo.toml to use published candle crates from crates.io instead of workspace dependencies
- Maintain all existing functionality while making it standalone
- Preserve comprehensive test coverage
- Set up independent CI/CD pipeline

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [x] Crate builds and tests pass independently ✅ (8/8 tests pass)
- [ ] Published on crates.io
- [x] Comprehensive documentation and examples ✅ (README.md, examples/)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline working
- [x] API can evolve independently from main Candle project ✅ (Independent git repo)
- [x] Users can easily integrate CoreML inference into their Candle projects ✅ (Ready to use)
