# candle-coreml Standalone Crate Project

## PURPOSE
Extract candle-coreml from the Candle monorepo into a standalone publishable crate on crates.io, providing CoreML inference capabilities for Candle users independently of the main project.

## PROJECT MOTIVATION
- Original PR to Candle was ignored
- Need freedom to take the API in our own direction
- Provide CoreML integration as an add-on that can be referenced from Candle documentation
- Give users access to CoreML inference without waiting for upstream integration

## CURRENT STATUS: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Independent Repository Created!

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS
‚úÖ DECIDED: Keep name as `candle-coreml`
- Describes exactly what it does (CoreML inference for Candle)
- Different from `coreml-rs` (generic swift-bridge bindings) 
- Our implementation uses objc2 directly with Candle-specific integration

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Research & Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. ‚úÖ Research current candle-coreml structure and dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Research and decide on crate name (candle-coreml chosen)
3. ‚úÖ Create new standalone crate structure with proper Cargo.toml
4. ‚úÖ Extract and adapt candle-coreml code for standalone use

### Phase 2: Dependencies & Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
5. ‚úÖ Update dependencies to use published candle crates from crates.io
6. ‚úÖ Move standalone crate outside of Candle repo and init as new git repo
7. ‚úÖ Remove any remaining Candle workspace dependencies
8. ‚úÖ Create comprehensive documentation and examples

### Phase 3: Publication Preparation
9. ‚è≥ Set up CI/CD for the standalone crate
10. ‚è≥ Prepare crate metadata for Cargo registry publication
11. ‚úÖ Test standalone crate thoroughly before publication (8/8 tests pass)

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS FROM coreml-rs

| Feature | coreml-rs | Our candle-coreml |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Bindings | swift-bridge | objc2 direct |
| Purpose | Generic CoreML | Candle tensor integration |
| Scope | Raw CoreML bindings | Complete inference engine |
| Integration | None | Candle device validation, tensor conversion |
| Error Handling | Generic | Candle error types |
| API Style | Generic | Follows Candle patterns (like candle-metal) |

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION FEATURES
- CoreMLModel and CoreMLModelBuilder following T5-like patterns
- Device validation (accepts CPU/Metal, rejects CUDA)
- Comprehensive tensor conversion (F32/I64‚ÜíI32 support)
- Full MLMultiArray ‚Üî Tensor conversion
- Integration tests with real .mlmodelc files
- Follows Candle conventions and error handling

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
- Extract existing candle-coreml code from monorepo
- Update Cargo.toml to use published candle crates from crates.io instead of workspace dependencies
- Maintain all existing functionality while making it standalone
- Preserve comprehensive test coverage
- Set up independent CI/CD pipeline

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [x] Crate builds and tests pass independently ‚úÖ (8/8 tests pass)
- [ ] Published on crates.io
- [x] Comprehensive documentation and examples ‚úÖ (README.md, examples/)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline working
- [x] API can evolve independently from main Candle project ‚úÖ (Independent git repo)
- [x] Users can easily integrate CoreML inference into their Candle projects ‚úÖ (Ready to use)

## üéâ MILESTONE ACHIEVED
**Independent candle-coreml repository successfully created!**

üìç **Location**: `/Users/mazdahewitt/projects/candle-coreml/`

## REPOSITORY STATUS
- ‚úÖ Independent git repository initialized
- ‚úÖ Initial commit with clean history
- ‚úÖ Published Candle dependencies (candle-core 0.9.1)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive README and documentation
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (integration and unit tests)
- ‚úÖ Examples directory with working code
- ‚úÖ Proper .gitignore and project structure

## NEXT PHASE: Publication Ready
Ready to continue with:
1. Setting up GitHub repository
2. Configuring CI/CD pipeline
3. Preparing crates.io publication metadata
4. Publishing to crates.io

The crate is now completely independent and ready for development!
